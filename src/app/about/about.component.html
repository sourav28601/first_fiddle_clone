          1999 by Priyank Sukhija and Y.P. Ashok. Since then, the company has made a name for itself as innovators and
          leaders in the industry. Starting with their first brand, Lazeez Affaire, Priyank popularised the conceptof
          fine dining at a time when the same was unheard of. Following its success, First Fiddle introduced the concept
          of casual dining with brands such as Warehouse Cafe, Tamasha, Lord of The Drinks, Flying Saucer Cafe, and
          more, storming Delhi’s nightlife. WIth each new brand, First Fiddle brought a concept that was never
          experienced or heard of before, such as Plum by Bent Chair, Miso Sexy, Diablo, and more. The restaurants are
          spread all over India in major metropolitan cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow and more, with plans
          to expand internationally soon.</p>
